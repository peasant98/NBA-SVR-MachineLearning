# NBA-SVR-MachineLearning
The second part of my NBA API testing with SVM in Python (this time, it's Support Vector Regression).

The goal of this project was to calculate the records of every team in the NBA since 2011 (except for 2012, because the data was empty there).
A user can put in the conference, the division, and if they want the team to make the playoffs/win their division/win the conference. From here,
the SVR will output the record that a team should have based on their division and conference, and where they should be seeded in the NBA playoffs.
I felt like this was fitting especially since the past several years (I'd go as far to say <b>decade</b>) have seen higher competitiveness in the Western Conference than the Eastern Conference. West is best!


NOTE: A graphical representation of the West's better records over the East will be coming shortly!
